    <a class="a-about">
        <p>The self - financed courses was initially started under the roof of Department of Computer Science. The professional courses like Bachelors in Computer Application (BCA) and Bachelors of Information technology (BSc-IT) was started in the year 2006 and 2008 respectively. The main purpose to introduce these courses was that because of the growing use of Computers and Information Technology in our day to day life, it is necessary that we have the trained man power to manufacture, maintain and use the Computers as well as write the software required for the effective and efficient use of the computers. A new genre of manpower / managers is required to harness the awesome
            capabilities of Information Technology and to tap the potential of this tool to its maximum.</p>
            &nbsp;
            <p>The BCA and Bsc-IT courses is designed and introduced by Gauhati University to bridge this gap and produce employable graduate in Information technology which will enable the industry to grow and he graduates to become successful in the field of Information Technology.</p>
            &nbsp;
        <p>The program covers the various essential concepts in Computer Science like :</p>
        &nbsp;  
        <p>a) The course lays a structured foundation of Computer fundamentals, Numerical
            methods, Data structure, and Algorithm and Complexity analysis, Software
            Engineering.</p>
            &nbsp;
            <p>b) Programming Concepts in various languages (C, C++, Java, Visual Basic etc.)</p>
            &nbsp;
            <p>c) The program covers the concept of Computer Networking, System Programming and
            Administration, Operating System, Digital Image Processing, Embedded systems,
            Computer Architecture and Microprocessor.</p>
            &nbsp;
            <p>d) It also provides detail knowledge PHP programming, Numerical methods,
            Combinatorial optimization, Computer Graphics and Database management system.</p>
            &nbsp;
            <p>e) An exceptionally broad range of topics covering current trends and technologies in
            computer science: Programming in Python, Cyber Security, Data mining, R-
            Programming, Data Sciences, Artificial Intelligence and Android Programming.</p>
            &nbsp;
            <p>Also, to carry out the hand on sessions in Computer lab using various Programming
            languages and tools to have a deep conceptual understanding of the topics to widen the
            horizon of students self-experience.</p>
            &nbsp;
            <p> The students after completing these course are joining software companies like WIPRO , TCS , CTS and ATMECS. The students who want pursue higher education are joining different Institutes and Universities like - AEC, Tezpur University, Gauhati University, Pondicherry University for their Masterâ€™s Program.
